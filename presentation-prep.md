TODO maybe inverse poly error?

# Challenges with sampling

* Sampling and decision are equivalent classically. De-randomize by choosing a seed, then run bit-by-bit. Unclear how to do in quantum
* Can't do "majority vote" amplification

Natural solution: run many copies in parallel
Analysis is quite involved
de Finetti doesn't work again - this is computational

# Blindness

to be honest, the construction is so simple that I don't know if everyone just missed it or if this is just folklore... but here goes nothing.
You basically just hit our protocol from before with a homomorphic encryption scheme.
You can pretty much do the same thing to any of the earlier works in this same line of literature too.

# Future directions

Inverse poly error...
Negligible is achievable if client is quantum. (MPQC and VQFHE settings)
